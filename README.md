## About the Book
When it comes to microcontrollers, the first word that comes to mind is Arduino. If you are keen on developing various wired and wireless models, or simply want to know more about how an Arduino works, this book is for you.

Complete with numerous real-life based examples, this book will help you design projects comprehensively using the Arduino Uno board. The book starts with the importance of Arduino and its usefulness for prototyping projects along with the installation for Arduino IDE. From there, it dives into various C and C++ based programming Arduino projects that will help you become fluent with controlling displays and speakers, sensor based applications such as temperature and proximity detection, motor control, I2C and SPI communications and much more besides. The book will also teach you to connect Bluetooth and WiFi to your Arduino device to design smartphone controlled robots and Internet clocks. You will also learn how to design IoT based projects via CAN Bus Communication.

By the end of this book , you will be an experienced developer with hands-on skills in designing projects using Arduino. By making these projects, you will feel confident to translate your own ideas into working prototypes and boost your familiarity with the world's most popular microcontroller.
